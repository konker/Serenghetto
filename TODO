TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Exceptions
    - proper runtime exceptions in case e.g. db cannot be accessed
    - catch all null pointer exceptions etc and gracefully close?
    
- Game
    - center position automatically according to location
        - can we set zoom level according to the accuracy?
        - should be able to turn this off/on?
        - could have explicit button for this (target button)?
        - should we remember last position/zoom for next time that app is opened?
            - where to store?
                - db?
                - prefs?
                - fs?

    - draw blobs on map overlay
        - can we get the GPS coordinates of current viewport?
            - query server for all barcodes within the given viewport specifications

    - have map move to a point given by paramter (Codes -> Game)

- Codes
    - nicer rendering of rows
    - indicator if location is present?
    - handle the case of no name?
    - sort orders?

- BarcodeView/Scan
    - only have one layout for barcode scan/view?
    - if location available draw some kind of marker on the map?
    - if location available can we set zoom level according to the accuracy?
    
- Service
    - Is service stopping when app is stopping?
        - even Activity.onPause -> pause service?

- Application
    - work out how to stop BarcodeScanActivity from changing orientation
    - work out how to stop some screens from being in the "history stack"
        - e.g. Codes -> BarcodeView -> Codes
            - don't want <- button to go back to BarcodeView
        - e.g. MainActivity -> Game
            - don't want <- button to go back to MainActivity
